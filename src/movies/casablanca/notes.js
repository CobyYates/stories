Half lit, half in shadow, the lighting emphasizes the duality in Rick’s character: outwardly confident, inwardly needy. The deep shadows on the cafe interior show it also in a new way, tomblike and devoid of the previous bustle and human energy. This is the dark interior of the world of Casablanca, and not only Rick but all the denizens of the city share in this darkness underneath the facade of gaiety. A slow dolly back from the initial closeup on Rick reinforces his isolation as we end up in a long shot. Then a searchlight from the airport sweeps the room, reminding us that there are spying eyes everywhere and adding a sense of paranoia. This searchlight is also an important planting.`

These kinds of devices are used less today, since todays audiences are more used to flashbacks and aren’t confused by them the way earlier audiences could have been.`
